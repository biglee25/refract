                  <p>My own personal venture into the world of post production has improved my skills and understanding
              of what it takes to produce an eye catching piece of work. I have been using applications like Adobe
              Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects for over 5 years and other applications like DavVnci Resolve and
              Logic Pro to improve the end product of my work.

              <p>
              I have found them to have been crucial in my development
              in post production. Developing my skills through such outlets has helped me to grow a sense of perfectionism
              for the work I have created.</p>

                  <p>Working as a freelance video editor in my spare time shows I am committed and passionate for the post production industry and am always willing to know how I can better my work. I have used my criticism of post production to look at it as more of an art than a form of entertainment. Freelance video editing helps me gain lots of professionalism and I always enjoy doing it as I would say it is one of my hobbies.</p>

              Working as a freelance video editor for 2 years taught me commitment and time management skills. I have
              used my criticism of post production in this period to look at it as more of an art than a form of entertainment.
              Freelance video editing helped me gain lots of experience in the post production field and I always enjoyed my
              time collaborating and creating new exciting projects.
              During the 2 years of freelance video editing I have worked with a number of different clients who have always
              been impressed with my work. Some clients I have worked with have been kind enough to give me working references
              for future opportunities that may come my way.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>During my time at college I have learnt a lot studying media. I have learnt a range of camera
                techniques that have been helpful with succeeding in assessed work. College has also helped
                me progress with my post production skills, receiving feedback from teachers and peers has
                helped me to identify what areas I need to improve on and has been crucial for my progression.
                Throughout my time at college my progression has been prominent and I have been able to act
                on mistakes I have made in past projects. I feel taking Media at college will be of great benefit to
                my studies at university as it has given me the foundation to better my work further and become
                successful in the post production industry.</p>

            <p>The Industry of Digital media and post production has a wide range of job opportunities available.
              Through my Freelance journey it has made me realise what I could shape my career to be.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Working with a popular gaming organisation Acend opened my eyes to
                this. The Head of the creative team at Acend, Daan Driessen, said that I have “ A Great work
                ethic and Professionalism” During my time at there, my job required me to be knowledgeable
                about current trends as well as having a good understanding of various editing tools such as
                Adobe Premier Pro and Adobe After Effects. Both Daan and I feel I fulfilled these requirements
                perfectly and was able to use these skills to produce work of the required standard. During my
                time working for them, I was able to gain other skills such as communication and
                professionalism, this was required of me during team meetings with other members of staff. I
                feel this profession as a whole moulds well with my future goals in post production.</p>
                <br/>
          <div>
            <p>My part time work as a Digital technician requires the ability to deal with a variety of different
                scenarios at one time. Other skills required of me are to work well as a part of a team, be
                confident in suggesting new ideas on how to better the company and workflow and to have a
                good knowledge of technical equipment such as machines and computers. These skills are
                something that can be translated over to my college work as working with a client and
                understanding their needs is something that is required in the post production Industry.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Overall, I believe the skills I have learnt through my freelance work, college and part time work
                will help me prosper while at university. I believe that studying post production will give me great
                opportunities to thrive at any career in the digital media industry or other related areas that I
                may decide to pursue.
