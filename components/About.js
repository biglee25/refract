                      <p>My own personal venture into the world of post production has improved my skills and understanding of what it takes to produce an eye catching piece of work. I have been using applications like Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects for over 2 years and have found them to have been crucial in my development in post production. Developing my skills through such outlets has helped me to grow a sense of perfectionism for the work I have created.</p>

                      <p>Working as a freelance video editor in my spare time shows I am committed and passionate for the post production industry and am always willing to know how I can better my work. I have used my criticism of post production to look at it as more of an art than a form of entertainment. Freelance video editing helps me gain lots of professionalism and I always enjoy doing it as I would say it is one of my hobbies.</p>

                      <p> During the past 2 years of video editing I have worked with a number of different clients who have always been impressed with the work I have done for them. Some clients I have worked with have been kind enough to give me working references for future opportunities that may come my way.</p>
